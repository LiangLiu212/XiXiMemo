\section{Systematic uncertainty}
The sources of systematic uncertainties are listed as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Reconstruction of $\Lambda$: decay length, chi2?
	\item Reconstruction of $\Xi$: decay length, chi2?
	\item Reconstruction of $\pi^0$; chi2? control sample?
	\item Reconstruction of $\pi^\pm$ control sample?
	\item Kinematic Fit :  chi2 , helix correction
	\item Mass cut : barlow test
	\item Cos theta cut : barlow test
	\item Fitting method : 
	\item Mis-combination background : mDIY and sideband
	\item exclusive Background : mDIY and side band
\end{itemize}
